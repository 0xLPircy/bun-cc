BUN

Bun.serve for server
watchmode - like nodemon `bun --watch index.ts`
HOT Reload: to change state without extra Reload
            - `bun --hot index.ts`
ENV: - unlike node we dont have to install a package called .env
     - can do Bun.env.VARNAME instead of process.env.VARNAME

SCRIPTS: 
     - we can add start and watch scripts

ROUTES:
     - we can read the routes, simple url.pathname stuff
     - ` const url = new URL(req.url);
        if (url.pathname === "/") return new Response("HomePage!");
        if (url.pathname === "/blog") return new Response("Blog!");
        return new Response("404!"); `

BUN X: 
    - similar to npx
    - just do ` bunx packagename `
    - eg: ` npx create-react-app `

NODE CORE MODULES:
     - all core node stuff works such as path, path.xyz etc
     - can use both import and require syntax

FILE I/O API:
     - can use fs etc but has better
     - has top level async so dont need to include it with await functions (?) 
     - can use functions (as in file.ts)
